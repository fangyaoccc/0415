1.To add a GUI to a Java program, we have to use Java's built-in libraries like AWT or Swing. 
Example: import Swing libraries and create main frame,add components and set layout and add behavior and lastly disply the windows.

2.AWT stand for: Abstract Windowing Toolkit and is one of the first Java libraries used for creating window-based applications. It provides a set of GUI components like buttons, text fields, and frames.

3.Swing is a part of Java's standard library that builds upon AWT and provides a more sophisticated set of GUI components. Unlike AWT, 
Swing components are lightweight and not dependent on the native OS's GUI, as they are written entirely in Java. 
Swing components start with the letter 'J', such as JFrame, JButton, JTable, and so forth.
